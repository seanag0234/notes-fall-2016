	Ephesians

		Predestination (Calvinist view)- what you doesn't acually impact anything 
			Paul uses "pro orizo" in his writings
				pro - "in advance"
				orizo - "to see"
			Really Paul's point is that the House of Israel is going to be saved so you should join the house of Israel. One of the things set in stone along with things like the Second Coming, Death, Resurrection, Christ's victory over Satan

		Paul jumps right into the things with Ephesians
		Collosians is about fear Ephesians is about fate
		Prophecy about wolves and sheep in Acts is about Ephesus first
		Paul and Unity
			United in doctrine
			United against "the world"
				In the world, but not of the world
			United in Family (Ephesians 5:22-25)
				Paul's words were somewhat revolutionary for his time
					Telling husbands to love their wives
					Husband -> Wife as Jesus -> Church
						LOVE is the message
						The family unit is so important that Jesus modeled how it should be done
			Unity between God and you
				This is done through God and His strength not amulets and other things like that

	Philippians

		Doctrinal heart is a Christ Hymn (Phillipians 2)
		Perhaps Paul's most personal epistle
		Church in Phillipi seems to have less problems than other churches around that Paul has started

		Two concerns to look for (not saying the church in Phillipi has these problems)
			Role of Law of Moses in defining Christianity
			The idea that transformed Christians can do anything they want with their physical bodies (all that matters is tending to their spirit - Corinth)

		Some kind of dispute between members in the church (Philippians 4)

		*True Yokefellow - possibly wife or missionary companion
		Admonition of Paul (4:8)
		Financial support - Paul receives financial support only from this church (4:15)

		Doctrinal Heart of Philippians is Chapter 2 (Christ Hymn)
			v6 
				 fundamentally on the inside Jesus is God 
				 Robbery should be translated to something not to be grasped, something he could put off (condescension of God)
			v7 
				 "kenosis" - to pour out, Jesus poured out His divinity into a body (talking about how Jesus became mortal) 
				 "servant" in KJV is always slave
				 	Jesus came down as a slave
			v8
				Jesus was crucified
			v9-11
				Jesus was restored to His exalted state
